# Configuring and Updating Microsoft Defender



## Introduction

In this project, I configured and updated Windows Security Virus & Threat Protection. Leveraging Windows Security's definitions, I ensured that the virtual machine was fortified against known threats by updating threat definitions. This proactive approach effectively thwarted potential vulnerabilities, thereby mitigating the risk of exploitation by threat actors. Furthermore, I conducted an Antivirus Quick Scan on the virtual machine, diligently monitoring for any signs of malware infiltration.

## Conclusion

To conclude, I managed Windows Security Virus & Threat Protection by updating threat definitions to safeguard the virtual machine. Although there were no actions needed to be taken, its always good practice to check for updates regularly for maintaining security. No immediate threats were discovered prior to the Antivirus Quick Scan, however, I conducted the scan to proactively monitor and detect potential malware intrusions.
